## Task 2

In Task 2, the requirement was to analyze the cleaned data and derive insights from the same which would then be used to recommend high value customers from amongst the list of 1000 new customers so that they can be targeted to drive the most value for Sprockets. 

The task is accomplished in 3 phases as instructed by the team - 

- #### 1. Data Exploration
  In this, first the data is cleaned and transformed to suit our analysis methodology. 
  After required cleaning and transformation, the past transaction and demographic data provided by Sprockets is analyzed using different dimensions - Age, Gender, Past bike related purchases, Wealth Segment, Location and Job Industry. These dimensions are used to visualize any trends/patterns in the customer count and the purchase records
  
- #### 2. Model Development
  For development of a model to categorize customers, I have used the RFM Analysis which categorizes customers by rating them on their Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value. The calculated scores are used to compute a combined RFM Score on basis of which customers are classified into 8 different categories - 
  
  - Almost Lost
  - Need Attention
  - Hibernating
  - Promising customers
  - Potential Loyalists
  - Loyal Customers
  - New Customers
  - Platinum Customers
  
- #### 3. Interpretation
  Over here, the different categories are explained as to what does each interpret, and also a relation between the different metrics that compose our RFM score are compared.
  
  A detailed presentation explaining the same is attached here. This presentation will be used to present our analysis to the client, which is also the requirement of our Task 2.
