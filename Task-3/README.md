## Task 3 - Data Insights and Presentation

In this task, all the analysis carried out upto Task 2 needs to be presented along with our final recommendations on the new high value customers, in the form of a Dashboard. Since Visualisations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct manner, we need to support our results and analysis in this form.

The Dashboard created by me can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/karan.rakesh.gupta#!/vizhome/KPMG-DataAnalysisandInsights/OldCustomerandTransactionAnalysis)

I have created a total of 2 Dashboards in this Workbook.

- ##### Old Customer and Transaction Analysis - 
In this Dashboard I have analyzed the Old Customer Dataset provided by Sprockets against the various dimensions - Age, State, Wealth Segment and Job Industry Category. It gives a brief idea regarding the distribution of old customers, and old transactions/sales of Sprockets. We can see and deduce which demographic was the most profitable in this.

- ##### High-Value New Customers - 
In this [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/karan.rakesh.gupta#!/vizhome/KPMG-DataAnalysisandInsights/OldCustomerandTransactionAnalysis), I present the list of Top High-Value customers from amongst the 1000 New Customers of Sprockets. The basis of selection of these new customers, is filtering of dimensions after observing the trends of old customers' transactions for different categories and demographics.
