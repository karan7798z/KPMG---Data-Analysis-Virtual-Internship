## Task 3 - Data Insights and Presentation

In this task, all the analysis carried out upto Task 2 needs to be presented along with our final recommendations on the new high value customers, in the form of a Dashboard. Since Visualisations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct manner, we need to support our results and analysis in this form.

The Dashboard created by me can be viewed ![here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/karan.rakesh.gupta#!/vizhome/KPMG-DataAnalysisandInsights/PastDemographicAnalysis)

I have created a total of 3 Dashboards.

- 1. Past Demographic Analysis - In this Dashboard I have analyzed the Old Customer Dataset provided by Sprockets against the various dimensions - Age, Gender, State, Wealth Segment and Job Industry. It gives a brief idea regarding the distribution of old customers of Sprockets.

- 2. Past Transaction Analysis - In this dashboard I have analyzed the past transaction record of Sprockets' customers. The categorization of customers has been used to identify the transaction trends of customers belonging to different categories. 

- 3. High-Value New Customers - In this [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/karan.rakesh.gupta#!/vizhome/KPMG-DataAnalysisandInsights/PastDemographicAnalysis), I present the list of Top High-Value customers from amongst the 1000 New Customers of Sprockets. The basis of selection of these new customers, is filtering of dimensions after observing the trends of old customers' transactions for different categories and demographics.
